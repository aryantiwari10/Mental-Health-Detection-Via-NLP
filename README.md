# Mental-Health-Detection-Via-NLP
This project aims to detect potential suicidal tendencies in users based on their social media text posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We use traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes), as well as a deep learning LSTM model for comparison.  Dataset: Reddit Suicide Watch posts labeled as suicide or non-suicide.
